## Slack Integration

> You can also get the output as a slack message

You will need to create [a slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1), visit the **OAuth & Permissions** tab, and add the `chat:write` and `chat:write.public` scopes. Then create an OAuth token from the "OAuth Tokens" section and pass it to the CLI.

> **Note:** The `--slack-channel` is the [channel id](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40940327/what-is-the-simplest-way-to-find-a-slack-team-id-and-a-channel-id#answer-44883343), not the name.

```bash
aws-cost --slack-token [token] --slack-channel [channel]
```

You will get the message on slack with the breakdown:

![Slack Usage](./.github/images/slack-usage.png)

You can set up a GitHub [workflow similar to this](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/c1a53cf3cc5c9b77634673754c8a5af4e83466d6/.github/workflows/aws-costs.yml#L1) which can send the daily cost breakdown to Slack.

## Note

Regarding the credentials, you need to have the following permissions in order to use the CLI:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iam:ListAccountAliases",
        "ce:GetCostAndUsage"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Also, please note that this tool uses AWS Cost Explorer under the hood which [costs $0.01 per request](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/pricing/).
